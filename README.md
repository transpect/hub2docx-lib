# hub2docx-lib

Create .docx files from Hub or DocBook XML. 

Another file that you’ll have to provide is a (possibly empty) .docx file that serves as a template for styles etc.

This is a library that needs to be integrated in your transpect project. There’s also a standalone frontend project, [hub2docx-frontend](https://github.com/transpect/hub2docx-frontend).
